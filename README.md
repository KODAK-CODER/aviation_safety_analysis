# Aviation Safety Analysis ✈️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of global aviation accident data to determine the safest aircraft makes and models. The goal is to provide data-driven procurement recommendations for a new aviation division.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python**: Data cleaning and EDA (Pandas, NumPy).
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
* **Tableau**: Interactive safety dashboard.
* **GitHub**: Version control and documentation.

## 📊 Key Insights
* **Safety Trends**: Identified a 20% decrease in fatal accidents over the last decade for commercial flights.
* **Top Aircraft**: Recommended Boeing and Airbus models based on the lowest accident-to-flight ratio.
* **Risk Factors**: Weather remains the primary external factor in non-fatal incidents.

## 📁 Repository Structure
* `aviation_safety_analysis.ipynb`: The primary Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code.
* `presentation.pdf`: A non-technical summary of the findings for stakeholders.
* `*.twbx`: The Tableau packaged workbook for visual exploration.
